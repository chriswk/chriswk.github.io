# Zombie Elm - Why

Been looking for some way to learn Elm.
I initially started on a memo game a month ago.
Motivation after long days at work being what it is, it sort of petered out, as all my hobbyprojects tend to do.

Then I saw [@odinodin][odinodin] tweet yesterday about [@mrundberget][magnus] spreading the love for elm at work and this triggered
my desire to pick it up again.
